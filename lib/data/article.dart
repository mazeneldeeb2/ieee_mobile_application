Though in reality, it is a difficult task to enable computers to recognize images of different objects\nComputer vision and image recognition are integral parts of artificial intelligence (AI), which has quickly gone from niche to mainstream in the past few years.\nAnd now we can see its applications increase everywhere such as self-driving cars and Digital- Signage.\nSimply Computer vision is the science and technology of machines that see their future of Engineering and software developers.",
